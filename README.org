* exchange2org

This is how it looks on my agenda:

[[file:screenshot_emacs.png]]

The "⦿"-characters are links to the corresponding Outlook items. Read [[https://github.com/novoid/dot-emacs/blob/master/config.org#links-to-outlook-entities][my
configuration on how to open outlook links]].

Those are the source appointments from my Outlook 2016 (dark theme):

[[file:screenshot_outlook.png]]

Here is how I get the appointments from Outlook to [[http://karl-voit.at/orgmode/][Org-mode]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output :wrap src
./exchange2org/__init__.py --help
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_src
usage: /usr/bin/exchange2org [-h] [--calendar] [--startday date-or-days]
                             [--endday date-or-days]
                             [--ignore-category CATEGORY] [-s] [-v] [-q]
                             FILE

This tool connects to your Exchange server and extracts data
in Org-mode format.

Please do note that this is a TEMPORARY stand-alone tool which will
be added to Memacs as an module as soon as Memacs got migrated to
Python 3:   https://github.com/novoid/memacs/

You can configure the behavior and output via a configuration file.

Example usages:
  exchange2org --calendar some/subfolder/my_exchange_calendar.org
      … writes your calendar events into the Org-mode file.

positional arguments:
  FILE                  The filename of the output file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --calendar            Extract the calendar as Org-mode events.
  --startday date-or-days
                        Starting date for fetching data. Default: 60 days in
                        past. "date-or-days" is either of form "YYYY-MM-DD" or
                        a number.
  --endday date-or-days
                        End date for fetching data. Default: 60 days in
                        future. "date-or-days" is either of form "YYYY-MM-DD"
                        or a number.
  --ignore-category CATEGORY
                        Category whose events will be omitted.
  -s, --dryrun          enable dryrun mode: simulate what would happen, do not
                        modify anything
  -v, --verbose         enable verbose mode
  -q, --quiet           enable quiet mode

- Hosted on github: https://github.com/novoid/exchange2org
- Will be discontinued and merged into
  https://github.com/novoid/memacs/ as soon as Memacs got migrated to
  Python 3.

** Installation

Clone it via [[https://github.com/novoid/filetags][GitHub]] or install =pip exchange2org=

You're going to need a configuration file. On GNU/Linux, this is:
=$HOME/.config/exchange2org/exchange2orgconfig.py=

This repository (as well as the pip package) comes with [[file:exchange2org/exchange2orgconfig-TEMPLATE.py][a template
file]] named =exchange2orgconfig-TEMPLATE.py= you can modify to meet
your requirements.

** Automatization

I personally run following command via cron Monday to Friday during office hours:

: $HOME/src/exchange2org/exchange2org/__init__.py --calendar --startday 7 \
:     --endday 45 $HOME/org/exported-company-calendar.org -q --ignore-category 'Org-mode'

On Sunday, I archive my calendar with the following script:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#!/bin/sh

TMPFILE=`mktemp`
ARCHIVEFILE='$HOME/org/memacs/company-calendar-archive.org_archive'

# It gets the previous 7 days of events, greps out the header (take
# only lines starting with two asterisks) and appends them to the
# archive file:

$HOME/src/exchange2org/exchange2org/__init__.py --calendar --quiet \
         --startday 7 --endday 0 --ignore-category 'Org-mode' "${TMPFILE}" && \
    egrep '\*\* <' "${TMPFILE}" >> "${ARCHIVEFILE}" && \
    rm "${TMPFILE}"
#end
#+END_SRC

When I categorize an Outlook-appointment with "Org-mode", the commands
above ignore the appointment. This is quite handy when you have
created (or copied) a manual event for that very same appointment and
you don't want to have it twice in your agenda. Please note that you
can right-click any appointment in your calendar to assign categories
without sending updates or similar annoyances.
